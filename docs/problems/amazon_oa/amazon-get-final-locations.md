# [Get Final Location](https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-get-final-locations)

**Easy** | **NN minutes** | **Hash Table, Sorting**

Amazon stores its data on different servers at different locations. From time to time, due to several factors, Amazon needs to move its data from one location to another. This challenge involves keeping track of the locations of Amazon's data and reporting them at the end of the year.
    


    At the start of the year, Amazon's data was located at n different locations. Over the course of the year, Amazon's data was moved from one server to another m times. Precisely, in the ith operation, the data was moved from movedFrom[i] to movedTo[i]. Find the locations of the data after all m moving operations. Return the locations in ascending order.
    


    Note:
    


      It is guaranteed that for any movement of data:
        
          There is data at movedFrom[i].
          There is no data at movedTo[i].

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `locations = [1, 7, 6, 8]`, `movedFrom = [1, 7, 2]`, `movedTo = [2, 9, 5]`

**Output:** `[5, 6, 8, 9]`

**Explanation:** Data begins at locations listed in locations. Over the course of the year, the data was moved three times. Data was first moved from movedFrom[0] to movedTo[0], from 1 to 2. Next, data was moved from 7 to 9, and finally, from location 2 to 5.
    
In the end, the locations where data is present are [5, 6, 8, 9] in ascending order.
