# [Find Minimum Days](https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-find-minimum-days)

A student is preparing for a scholarship test which is organized on the Amazon Academy platform and scheduled for next month.

There are n chapters to be studied, where the i-th chapter has pages[i] pages. On each day, the student chooses some window of exactly k consecutive chapters. From each chapter in that chosen window, the student reads up to p of its remaining pages: the remaining page count of every chapter in the window is reduced by p. If a chapter has fewer than p pages remaining, the student reads all of its remaining pages and its remaining page count becomes 0 (it never goes negative). A chapter already at 0 remaining pages may still lie inside a chosen window; it simply stays at 0.

Find the minimum number of days the student needs so that the remaining page count of every chapter is 0.

Note: The k chapters chosen each day must be contiguous, and each chosen window must lie fully within the chapters (its starting index ranges over 0 to n - k).

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `pages = [3, 1, 4]`, `k = 2`, `p = 2`

**Output:** `4`

**Explanation:** There are n=3 chapters with pages=[3,1,4], k=2 consecutive chapters per day, and up to p=2 pages read from each chosen chapter per day. One optimal sequence (4 days):
Day 1: Choose chapters 1 and 2. Remaining pages: [1, 0, 4].
Day 2: Choose chapters 1 and 2. Remaining pages: [0, 0, 4].
Day 3: Choose chapters 2 and 3. Remaining pages: [0, 0, 2].
Day 4: Choose chapters 2 and 3. Remaining pages: [0, 0, 0].
Chapter 1 needs ceil(3/2)=2 coverings, chapter 2 needs ceil(1/2)=1, and chapter 3 needs ceil(4/2)=2. Since every window has length k=2 and must lie within the chapters, chapters 1 and 3 can never be covered by the same window, so their required coverings (2 + 2 = 4) cannot be combined into the same days. Hence the chapters cannot be completed in fewer than 4 days, and the answer is 4.

### Example 2

**Input:** `pages = [3, 4]`, `k = 1`, `p = 2`

**Output:** `4`

**Explanation:** Let's trace this sample case:

Day 1: Choose chapter 1 (pages = 3). Read min(3,2)=2 pages. Remaining pages: [3−2,4]=[1,4].
Day 2: Choose chapter 1 (pages = 1). Read min(1,2)=1 page. Remaining pages: [1−1,4]=[0,4].
Day 3: Choose chapter 2 (pages = 4). Read min(4,2)=2 pages. Remaining pages: [0,4−2]=[0,2].
Day 4: Choose chapter 2 (pages = 2). Read min(2,2)=2 pages. Remaining pages: [0,2−2]=[0,0].

So, for this sample case, the minimum number of days would be 4.
