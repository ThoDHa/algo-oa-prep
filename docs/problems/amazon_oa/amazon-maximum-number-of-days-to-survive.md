## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `lender = [4, 6, 1, 8]`
**Input:** `payback = [7, 10, 3, 9]`

**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:** Choose lender -> 1, so payback is 3.Choose lender -> 4, repay previous payback 3, hence remaining 4-3 = 1 (borrower spends it), the current Payback is 7.Choose lender -> 8, repay previous payback 7, hence remaining 8-7 = 1 (borrower spends it), the current Payback is 9.Left with lender -> 6, cannot repay previous payback which is 9, 9 > 6 hence default.
        So the borrower can survive 3 days.

### Example 2

**Input:** `lender = [2, 1, 5]`
**Input:** `payback = [2, 2, 5]`

**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:** The borrower can pay back each day's loan with the next day's borrowed money without any leftover, thus surviving for all 3 days.

### Example 3

**Input:** `lender = [1, 1, 1, 2]`
**Input:** `payback = [2, 2, 2, 3]`

**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:** Choose lender -> 1, so payback is 2.Choose lender -> 1, repay previous payback 2, hence no remaining (borrower spends it), the current Payback is 2.Left with lender -> 1, cannot repay previous payback which is 2, 2 > 1 hence default.
        So the borrower can survive 2 days.
