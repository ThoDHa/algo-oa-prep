## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `numProducts = [7, 4, 5, 2, 6, 5]`

**Output:** `12`

**Explanation:** These are some ways strictly increasing subarrays can be chosen (1-based index):
      
• Choose subarray from indices (1, 3) and pick products (3, 4, 5) respectively from each index, which is 12 products. Note that we are forced to pick only 3 products from index 1 as the maximum number of products we can pick from index 2 is 4, and we need to make sure that it is greater than the number of products picked from index 1.
      
• Choose subarray from indices (3, 6) and pick products (1, 2, 4, 5) respectively from each index, which is 12 products. Similar to the above case, we are forced to pick only 1 product from index 3 as the maximum number of products at index 4 is only 2.
      
• Choose subarray from indices (3, 5) and pick products [1, 2, 6] respectively from each index, which is 9 products.

* Choose subarray from indices (1, 1) and pick all the 7 products.

The max num of products is 12 :)

### Example 2

**Input:** `numProducts = [2, 9, 4, 7, 5, 2]`

**Output:** `16`

**Explanation:** A few examples of how you can pick the products (1-based index):
      
• Choose subarray from indices (1, 2) and pick products (2, 9) respectively from each index, which is 11 products.
      
• Choose subarray from indices (1, 4) and pick products (2, 3, 4, 7), which is 16 products.
      
• Choose subarray from indices (1, 5) and pick products (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is 15 products.

### Example 3

**Input:** `numProducts = [2, 5, 6, 7]`

**Output:** `20`

**Explanation:** Take all the products as they already are in incresing order.

(p.s. the source image is super blurry, I kinda think output is 20)

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 5000`
- `1 ≤ numProducts[i] ≤ 10^9`

     on the solutions branch later. See ../_TEMPLATE.md for the
     expected layout, naming, and ordering conventions. -->
