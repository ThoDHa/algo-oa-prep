    Amazon is building a new data center with n servers of different types. The health and type of each server are represented in the arrays health and serverType. The developers need to build a server facility with a maximum of k distinct types of servers and the sum of their health should be maximized.
    


    Given arrays health and serverType, find the maximum sum of the health for up to k types of servers.
    


      Complete the function getMaximumSum in the editor.
      


      getMaximumSum has the following parameters:
        


          int health[n]: the health of each server
          int serverType[n]: the type of each server
          int k: the maximum number of distinct types
        
        long int: the maximum sum of health of the selected servers

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `health = [4, 5, 5, 6]`, `serverType = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, `k = 1`

**Output:** `11`

**Explanation:** Since k = 1, all selected servers must be the same type. The better option is to select type 2 servers. The maximum sum of health for type 2 servers is 5 + 6 = 11. Return 11.

### Example 2

**Input:** `health = [1, 2, 3, 10, 10]`, `serverType = [3, 3, 1, 2, 5]`, `k = 2`

**Output:** `20`

**Explanation:** With k = 2, the best option is to select servers of types 1 and 5. The maximum sum of health for these types is 2 + 3 + 10 = 15 for type 1 and 10 for type 5, which adds up to 20. Return 20.

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ health[i] ≤ 10^9`
- `1 ≤ serverType[i] ≤ n`
