# [Optimizing Box Weights](https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-minimal-heaviest-set-a)

**Easy** | **NN minutes** | **Array, Sorting, Greedy**

An Amazon Fulfillment Associate has a set of items that need to be packed into two boxes. Given an integer array of the item weights (arr) to be packed, divide the item weights into two subsets, A and B, for packing into the associated boxes, while respecting the following conditions:
    

The intersection of A and B is null.The union of A and B is equal to the original array.The number of elements in subset A is minimal.The sum of A's weights is greater than the sum of B's weights.
    Return the subset A in increasing order where the sum of A's weights is greater than the sum of B's weights. If more than one subset A exists, return the one with the maximal total weight.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `arr = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2]`

**Output:** `[4, 5]`

**Explanation:** The subset of A that satisfies the conditions is [4, 5]:

        

A is minimal (size 2)Sum(A) = (4 + 5) = 9 > Sum(B) = (1 + 2 + 2 + 3) = 8The intersection of A and B is null and their union is equal to arr.The subset A with the maximal sum is [4, 5].

### Example 2

**Input:** `arr = [4, 2, 5, 1, 6]`

**Output:** `[5, 6]`

**Explanation:** The subset of A that satisfies the conditions is [5, 6]:
     
        

A is minimal (size 2)Sum(A) = (5 + 6) = 11 > Sum(B) = (1 + 2 + 4) = 7Sum(A) = (4 + 6) = 10 > Sum(B) = (1 + 2 + 5) = 8The intersection of A and B is null and their union is equal to arr.The subset A with the maximal sum is [5, 6].

### Example 3

**Input:** `arr = [3, 7, 5, 6, 2]`

**Output:** `[6, 7]`

**Explanation:** The 2 subsets in arr that satisfy the conditions for A are [5, 7] and [6, 7]:
     
        

A is minimal (size 2)Sum(A) = (5 + 7) = 12 > Sum(B) = (2 + 3 + 6) = 11Sum(A) = (6 + 7) = 13 > Sum(B) = (2 + 3 + 5) = 10The intersection of A and B is null and their union is equal to arr.The subset A where the sum of its weight is maximal is [6, 7].

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4 (where 0 ≤ i < n)`
