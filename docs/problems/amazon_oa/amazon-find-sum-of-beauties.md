Amazon's development team is working on a feature for a new product, a smart array processor. A user has provided an integer array called arr of size n and a 2-dimensional array called pairs of size m x 2. Each pair in pairs represents the starting and ending indices of a subarray within arr.
    


    For each subarray of arr represented by the array pairs, the goal is to merge and concatenate them into a new array called beautiful.
    


    The beauty of an element at index i in arr is defined as follows: if the index i has not contributed to the formation of the array beautiful, the beauty is the count of integers in beautiful that have a value strictly smaller than arr[i]. If the index i has contributed to the formation of the array beautiful, its beauty is 0.
    


    Find the sum of the beauties of all the elements in the array arr.
