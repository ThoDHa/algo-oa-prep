Amazon Academy recently organized a scholaship test on its platform.



There are nstudents with roll numbers 1, 2, ..., n who appeared for the test, where the rank secured by the ithstudent is denoted 
by rank[i]. Thus, the array rank is a permutation of length n. Groups can only be formed with students having consecutive roll numbers,
in other words, a subarray of the original array. For each value x (1 <= x <= n), find the number of groups that can be formed such that they have a 
mean rank equal to x.



More formally, given a permutaion of length n, find the number of subarrays of the given array having a mean value equal to x, for each 
xin the range [1, n].



Notes



1. The mean value of an array of kelements is defined as the sum of elements divided by k.
2. A permutation of leangth nis a sequence where each number from qtonappears exactly once.
3. A subarray of an array is a contiguous section of the array.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `rank = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

**Output:** `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`

**Explanation:** Read the above as 'For the mean x = 1, the group [1] has mean value 1. There is 1 group'. and so on. The full answer is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1].

### Example 2

**Input:** `rank = [4, 3, 2, 1]`

**Output:** `[1, 2, 2, 1]`

**Explanation:** x = 1 -> [1] x = 2 -> [3, 2, 1], [2] x = 3 -> [3], [4, 3, 2] x = 4 -> [4]

### Example 3

**Input:** `rank = [4, 7, 3, 6, 5, 2, 1]`

**Output:** `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1]`

**Explanation:** x = 1 -> [1] x = 2 -> [2] x = 3 -> [3] x = 4 -> [4], [3, 6, 5, 2], [7, 3, 6, 5, 2, 1], [4, 7, 3, 6, 5, 2 ,1] x = 5 -> [5], [7, 3], [4, 7, 3, 6] and [4, 7, 3, 6, 5] x = 6 -> [6] x = 7 -> [7]

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^3`
- `1 <= rank[i] <= n`
- `The array rank contains all distinct elemens, and thus, is a permutation of {1..n}.`
