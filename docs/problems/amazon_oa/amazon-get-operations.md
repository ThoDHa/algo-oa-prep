# [Get Operations](https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-get-operations)

**Hard** | **NN minutes** | **Array, Greedy, Sorting**

There are n processes. The i-th process has resource[i] number of resources. All the resource[i] are distinct. The CPU wants the processes to be arranged in increasing order of their resource[i]. The CPU does several operations to make this.



In each operation, the CPU selects an integer x and a process with number of
resources x. It then places all processes with resource values less than x before the
processes with resource values greater than or equal to x, maintaining their original order i.e. the relative order between processes having resource value less than x should be maintained and the same applies for processes having resource value greater than or equal to x.



Find the lexicographically smallest sequence of Xs that the CPU chooses, such that it takes the minimum number of operations to complete the task.



Note: If the minimum number of operations = 0, then return a sequence only
containing the integer -1.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `resource = [6, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1]`

**Output:** `[2, 3, 4, 6]`

**Explanation:** There MIGHT be something wrong in this explanation. I am not quite sure about it.
If you found anything wrong, pls feel free to lmk! Many thanks in advance! 🐳 Happy Coding! 



CPU can achieve the minimum number of operations in the following way (underlined elements denote the processes that have less than x resources):



Choose x=2: [6,4,3,5,2,1] -> [1, 6,4,3,5,2]



Choose x=3: [1, 6,4,3,5,2] -> [1, 2, 6,4,3,5]



Choose x=4: [1, 2, 6,4,3,5] -> [1, 2, 3, 6,4,5]



Choose x=6: [1, 2, 3, 6,4,5] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]



Minimum number of operations = 4, and the answer is [2, 3, 4, 6].

### Example 2

**Input:** `resource = [10, 5, 14, 12, 13]`

**Output:** `[14, 15]`

**Explanation:** The optimal way is:



Choose x = 14: [15, 10, 14, 12, 13] -> [10, 12, 13, 15, 14]



Choose x = 15: [10, 12, 13, 15, 14] -> [10, 12, 13, 14, 15]



So, the answer is [14, 15].

### Example 3

**Input:** `resource = [2, 4, 14, 10, 5, 3]`

**Output:** `[4, 10, 14]`

**Explanation:** The optimal way is:



Choose x = 4: [2, 4, 14, 10, 5, 3] -> [2, 3, 4, 14, 10, 5]



Choose x = 10: [2, 3, 4, 14, 10, 5] -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 14, 10]



Choose x = 14: [2, 3, 4, 5, 14, 10] -> [2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 14]



So, the answer is [4, 10, 14].

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`
- `1 ≤ resource[i] ≤ 10^9`
- `All resource[i] are distinct`
