# [Get Max Stability](https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-get-max-stability)

**Medium** | **NN minutes** | **Sorting, Greedy**

AWS provides a range of servers to meet the deployment needs of its clients. A client wants to choose a set of servers to deploy their application. Each server is
associated with an availability factor and a reliability factor.



The client defines the stability of a set of servers as the minimum availability amongst the servers multiplied by the sum of reliabilities of all the servers. Given two arrays of
integers, availability, and reliability, where the availability[i] and reliability[i] represent the availability and reliability factors of the ith server, find the maximum possible stability of
any subset of servers.



Since the answer can be large, report the answer modulo (10^9 + 7).

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `reliability = [1, 2, 2]`, `availability = [1, 1, 3]`

**Output:** `6`

**Explanation:** Consider the set of servers where reliability = [1, 2, 2] and availability = [1, 1, 3].



The possible subsets of servers are:



Indices {0}: Stability = 1*1 = 1
Indices {1}: Stability = 1*2 = 2
Indices {2}: Stability = 3*2 = 6
Indices {0, 1}: Stability = min(1, 1) * (1+ 2) = 3
Indices {0, 2}: Stability = min(1, 3) * (1+ 2) = 3
Indices {1, 2}: Stability = min(1, 3) * (2+2) = 4
Indices {0, 1, 2}: Stability = min(1, 1, 3) * (1+2+2) = 5

So the answer is the maximum stability for the set of index {2}, answer = 6 % 1000000007 = 6.

### Example 2

**Input:** `reliability = [75, 104, 72, 72, 8, 125]`, `availability = [1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1]`

**Output:** `5`

**Explanation:** Take servers at positions 1, 2, 4, and 6. This will cost 5 and the sum of efficiency values is 376.

## Constraints

- `1 < n ≤ 10^5`
- `1 <= reliability[i], availability[i] <= 10^6`
- `It is guaranteed that lengths of reliability and availability are the same.`
