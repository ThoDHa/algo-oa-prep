# [Find Min Max Difference](https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-find-min-max-difference)

**Hard** | **NN minutes** | **Sorting, Greedy**

Given one unsorted array of size n and integer k.
    


    From subsequences of size n-k, find the max of consecutive element dfferences in the sorted subsequences AND from these max differences return the min difference.
    


    A subsequence is any combination of integers.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `arr = [1, 4, 3, 6, 5]`, `k = 2`

**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:** Example - [1,4,3,6,5], k = 2, n-k = 3
Some Possible subequences of size 3 :

[4,3,1] (sorted) -> [1,3,4]
Diffs : 4-3 = 1, 3-1 = 1. Max of these is 1

[1,6,4] (sorted) -> [1,4,6]
Diffs : 6-4 = 2, 4-1 = 3. Max of these is 3

[3,6,5] (sorted) -> [3,5,6]
Diffs : 6-5 = 1, 5-3 = 2. Max of these is 2

Other subsequences follow....

Out of all possible sequences, we get the max diff in each subsequence.

Out of these maxes find the minimum diff.

In our case it's 1.
