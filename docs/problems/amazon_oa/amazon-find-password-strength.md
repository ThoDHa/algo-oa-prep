Hello! Did you navigate here from my sister question Password Strength 🐣?
    


    Another check pwd strength question you might be interested in:
    


    Find the password strength for a given password. For example, if the password is "good", 
    then iterate over all substrings and find the distinct character counts:
    


      g = 1,
      o = 1,
      o = 1,
      d = 1,
      go = 2,
      oo = 1,
      od = 2,
      goo = 2,
      ood = 2,
      good = 3
    
    At the end, add all the distinct character counts to determine the password strength. In this case, the password strength is 16.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:** `password = "good"`

**Output:** `16`

**Explanation:** Iterate over all substrings and find the distinct character counts:

      


        g = 1,
        o = 1,
        o = 1,
        d = 1,
        go = 2,
        oo = 1,
        od = 2,
        goo = 2,
        ood = 2,
        good = 3
      

The total strength is the sum of all distinct character counts: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 16.

### Example 2

**Input:** `password = "aa"`

**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:** Iterate over all substrings and find the distinct character counts:

"a"
"a"
"aa"

We return 2 because both "a" and "a" have dictinct character counts of 1.

1 + 1 = 2
