"""Count Stepping Numbers In Range — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-count-stepping-numbers-in-range

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-count-stepping-numbers-in-range.md

A stepping number is an integer whose adjacent digits differ by exactly 1. Every one-digit integer, including 0, is a stepping number.
