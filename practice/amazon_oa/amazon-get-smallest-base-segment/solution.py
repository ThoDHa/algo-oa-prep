"""Get Smallest Base Segment — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-get-smallest-base-segment

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-get-smallest-base-segment.md

In Amazon's distributed storage network, some critical data segments are missing. They are represented by a string missingData. The system restores data by choosing a base segment of length segmentSiz

  uv run pytest amazon_oa/amazon-get-smallest-base-segment/              # run the test sets
