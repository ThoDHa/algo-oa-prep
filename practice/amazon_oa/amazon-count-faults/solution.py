"""Count Faults (Faulty Binding 101 😁) — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-count-faults

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-count-faults.md

There are n servers with IDs s1, s2, ..., sn. You are given an array logs in chronological order. Each entry has the form "<server_id> <status>", where status is either success or error.

  uv run python amazon_oa/amazon-count-faults/solution.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest amazon_oa/amazon-count-faults/              # run the test sets
