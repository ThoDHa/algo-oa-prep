You are given a 2D grid board that represents a chessboard. The board contains multiple cells, where:

  uv run python amazon_oa/amazon-rooks-left/solution.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest amazon_oa/amazon-rooks-left/              # run the test sets
"""

        Time:  O(?):
        Space: O(?):
