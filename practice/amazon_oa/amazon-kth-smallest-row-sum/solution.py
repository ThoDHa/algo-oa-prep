"""Kth Smallest Sum from Sorted Matrix Rows — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-kth-smallest-row-sum

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-kth-smallest-row-sum.md

Given an integer matrix mat whose rows are sorted in nondecreasing order, choose exactly one value from each row and add the chosen values.
