"""Bit at an Index After Repeated Binary Expansion — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-indexed-bit-after-binary-expansion

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-indexed-bit-after-binary-expansion.md

Start with a binary string bits. In one expansion round, replace every character independently:0 becomes 00.1 becomes 10.After exactly rounds expansions, return the bit at the zero-based position inde
