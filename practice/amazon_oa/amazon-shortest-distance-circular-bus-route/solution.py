"""Shortest Distance on a Circular Bus Route — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-shortest-distance-circular-bus-route

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-shortest-distance-circular-bus-route.md

For this exercise, assume a bus route has n stops arranged in a circle. The array distance contains the distance from stop i to stop (i + 1) mod n.Given two distinct stops, start and destination, retu
