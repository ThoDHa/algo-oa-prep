"""Get Max Events — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-get-maximum-events

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-get-maximum-events.md

You are given an array payload of size n, where payload[i] represents the size of the (i)-th event payload. The task is to select a subset of events and rearrange them into a new array optimizedPayloa
