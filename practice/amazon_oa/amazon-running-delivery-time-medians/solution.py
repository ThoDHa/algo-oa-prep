"""Running Delivery Time Medians — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-running-delivery-time-medians

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-running-delivery-time-medians.md

Given an array deliveryTimes, process the values from left to right. After each new delivery time arrives, output the median of all delivery times seen so far.
