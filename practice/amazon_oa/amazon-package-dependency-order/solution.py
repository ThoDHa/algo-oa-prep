"""Package Dependency Order — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-package-dependency-order

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-package-dependency-order.md

You are given package dependency pairs and a target package. Each pair [package, dependency] means the package depends on that dependency.Return an order in which to install the target package and all
