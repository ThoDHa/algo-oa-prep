"""Minimize Binary Subsequence Cost — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-minimize-binary-subsequence-cost

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-minimize-binary-subsequence-cost.md

You are given a string binaryString consisting only of '0', '1', and '!', and two integers x and y.Replace every '!' with either '0' or '1'. After replacement, every subsequence equal to "01" contribu
