Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/check-similar-passwords.md

Amazon would like to enforce a password policy for password changes. For each pair of strings newPasswords[i] and oldPasswords[i], determine whether the two passwords are similar.

  uv run python amazon_oa/check-similar-passwords/solution.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest amazon_oa/check-similar-passwords/              # run the test sets
