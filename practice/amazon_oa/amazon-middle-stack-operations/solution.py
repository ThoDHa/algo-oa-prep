"""Stack with Constant-Time Middle Queries — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-middle-stack-operations

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-middle-stack-operations.md

Process a sequence of stack operations. Each operation is ["push", value], ["pop"], ["top"], or ["middle"]. Values are signed decimal integers encoded as strings.Return one string for every non-push o
