"""Maximum Saw Height for At Least M Cut Length — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-woodcut-saw-height

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-woodcut-saw-height.md

You have vertical wooden poles with integer heights heights. Set a saw to a non-negative integer height h; every pole taller than h contributes height - h units of wood, and shorter poles contribute n
