"""Minimum Time to Spread Through a Grid — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-rotting-oranges-variation

You are given a rectangular grid whose cells contain 0, 1, or 2. A zero is empty, a one is fresh, and a two is already active.After each minute, every active cell makes each orthogonally adjacent fres
