"""Maximum Score in Balanced String — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/maximum-score-in-balanced-string

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/maximum-score-in-balanced-string.md

Given a string s consisting of parentheses, you need to find the maximum score possible in a balanced substring of s. The score of a substring is calculated by choosing two indices i and j (0 <= i < j
