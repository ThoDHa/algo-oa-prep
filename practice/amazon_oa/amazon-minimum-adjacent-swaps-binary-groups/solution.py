"""Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Group Binary Values — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-minimum-adjacent-swaps-binary-groups

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-minimum-adjacent-swaps-binary-groups.md

You are given a binary array bits. Using adjacent swaps, rearrange it so that equal values form two contiguous groups.Either order is valid: all 0s before all 1s, or all 1s before all 0s. Return the m
