"""Minimum Moves for Two Knights to Meet — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-two-knights-minimum-meeting-moves

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-two-knights-minimum-meeting-moves.md

Two knights start at coordinates first = [x1, y1] and second = [x2, y2] on an infinite chessboard. They take turns, with the first knight moving first. On a turn, the chosen knight must make one stand
