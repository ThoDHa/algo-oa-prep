"""Find Days S2 Subsequence of S1 — https://www.fastprep.io/problems/amazon-find-days-s2-subsequence-of-s1

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/amazon_oa/amazon-find-days-s2-subsequence-of-s1.md

Given two strings s1 and s2, find till how many days is s2 a subsequence of s1 if on every day we delete all the strings in s1 from start to end inclusive.
